# Welcome
Hello, my name is Dmitrii Pedchenko. I am a research scientist currently working on machine learning infrastructure questions in Big Tech. Previously, I spent around 7 years in academia getting my PhD and working as a professor, both in pure math. Even before that I worked as a data scientist in busienss consulting.

My current research interests lie in mathematical foundations of Deep Learning. That said, I try to follow all the major advances in DL, both theoretical and practical. Most of my thinking is done together with Daniel Levine. However, all the mistakes and omissions in this blog are mine. 

You can reach me and check my work history at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-pedchenko-7464b11b0/).
